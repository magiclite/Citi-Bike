**Citi Bike Analysis**

Based on the usage of Citi Bikes in New York available from Citi Bike website (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) , I created a series of bubble maps for each hour of the day to show which stations are more frequently used than others.

●	The data I used are in September and February of 2018

●	Yellow bubbles show frequency of users starting their trips at the station

●	Blue bubbles show frequency of users ending their trips at the station

●	Size of bubbles is proportional to frequency of usage at each station (i.e. larger yellow bubbles at a station mean more users start their trips at the station)

●	The snapshots were generated at each hour (i.e. snapshot at 9am show frequency of trips taken at each station between 9am and 10am)

●	I used Python packages including Pandas, Numpy, and Folium in order to create data structures and bubble map
